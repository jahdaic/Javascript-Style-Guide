# Javascript Style Guide

## The Rules

* Tabs for indentation
* Single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping
* No unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs!
* Always use semicolons
* Space after keywords if (condition) { ... }
* Space after function name function name (arg) { ... }
* Always use === instead of == – but obj == null is allowed to check null or undefined.
* Always prefix browser globals with window – except document and navigator are okay
