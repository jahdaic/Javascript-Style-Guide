# Javascript Style Guide

## Basic Rules

* Tabs for indentation
* Spaces for spacing (ex. lining up variable assignments)
* Single quotes for strings, except to avoid escaping
* No unused variables
* Always use semicolons
* Space after keywords if (condition) { ... }
* Space after function name function name (arg) { ... }
* Always use === instead of == when possible, but obj == null is allowed to check null or undefined.
* Always prefix browser globals with window â€“ except document and navigator are okay
